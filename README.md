# WP22 Final Project - What Do You Meme? :trollface:

What Do You Meme? is an online party game that lets you compete with your friends and family to create the funniest memes!

## Description

Find out who will be crowned Meme Queen/King by competing with friends (or family if you’re brave) to match photo cards with caption cards, 
creating your own outrageously funny meme combinations. It’s the perfect excuse to call up the crew, and get everyone together for guaranteed laughs.
