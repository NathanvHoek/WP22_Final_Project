<p>Find 2 or more friends and sit around a table. If you don't have
2 or more friends, try joining a kickball league. It's a great way
to meet people nearby.</p>

<p>To start playing, each player gets 7 Caption Cards. Caption Cards
are the cards with captions on them. That's why we call them Caption Cards.</p>

<p>The person with the most Instagram followers typically starts as the judge. Unless they bought followers, or use 100 hashtags on each post.
If you have a friend who does that, slap them firmly in the face.</p>

<p>The judge then looks through the Photo Cards and selects the one they want to judge for that round.
They show it to everyone and then place it on the sexy little easel in front of them. Everyone else takes a few moments to decide which of their 7 Caption Cards pairs funniest with the Photo Card
in play and passes it to the judge, face down.</p>

<p>Once the judge has received a Caption Card from each player, they shuffle
them up and read them aloud one at a time. Make sure the Photo Card is visible to the whole group while the
Caption Cards are being read. It's wayyy funnier that way.</p>

<p>The judge then selects the funniest Caption Card and the player who played it wins that round. The winner keeps that Photo Card as a trophy (1 Photo Card = 1 point).
After the winner celebrates, every-one draws back up to 7 Captions Cards and the player on the judge's left
becomes the new judge for the next round.</p>

<p>Keep playing until you get hungry, at which point stop playing and order a pizza. The player with the most Photo Cards at the end of the game is the winner.</p>

<h3>Bonus rules</h3>
<p>If someone plays a "Freestyle card", ALL players have to make up a caption on the spot for that next round.
If your group is feeling shy, you can write them down on pieces of scrap paper and pass them in to the judge.
If your group is feeling brave/drunk, you can present them verbally.</p>

<p>If your Caption Cards all suck, you can always exchange one of your earned Photo Cards for a brand new hand of 7 Caption Cards.</p>

<p>We highly recommend adding your own photos to the game... you can't imagine how funny
it is to meme people you know in real life.</p>
